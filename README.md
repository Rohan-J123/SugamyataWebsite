# Sugamyata Project

**Sugamyata** is an initiative focused on raising **accessibility awareness**, teaching key accessibility guidelines, and providing interactive, technical games to identify and fix accessibility issues. The project is divided into three main buckets of games, each designed to educate and engage users in making digital platforms more inclusive and accessible.

## Project Overview

Sugamyata features a series of games aimed at enhancing accessibility knowledge:

1. **Accessibility Awareness**  
   Games in this bucket are designed to increase understanding and awareness of accessibility issues and challenges faced by people with disabilities.

2. **Teaching Guidelines**  
   This bucket focuses on teaching accessibility guidelines that are computer-science related and actionable. These guidelines follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), specifically focusing on **Level A** (about 25 guidelines). These include testable scenarios like ensuring videos have captions or images have alt-text.

3. **Identifying/Fixing Accessibility Issues**  
   Games in this category are technical in nature, focusing on finding and fixing code-related accessibility problems. Players get hands-on experience with real-world accessibility issues in codebases.

Each game is interactive, educational, and designed to be fun, while ensuring a practical understanding of the importance of digital accessibility.

## Website Structure

The project consists of two main HTML files:
- **Main Page**: Provides an overview of the project and invitations to collaborate with Sugamyata.
- **Buckets Page**: Offers a short introduction to each of the three buckets and links to the corresponding games.

## Goals

- **User Registration**: We plan to implement a login and registration system, allowing users to register once and access all the games.
- **Azure Deployment**: Initially, Sugamyata will be deployed as a static website on Azure.
- **Automated Deployment**: We aim to enable automatic deployment from GitHub to Azure so that any updates are reflected instantly.

## Completed Games

The project has successfully completed one game from each bucket:
- **Accessibility Awareness Game**: Helps players understand common accessibility barriers.
- **Guideline Teaching Game**: Focuses on teaching the Level A WCAG guidelines through interactive challenges.
- **Code-Fixing Game**: Involves identifying and fixing accessibility issues in a code-based environment.
